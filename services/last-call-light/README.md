# Last-call-light

This service is a demo that will be presented at ICC 2015. 
The service, when started periodically checks time schedule
from a google calendar plugin, filter out the events that are
either completed or not started. If an event is about finish,
the service dims out the lights of the meeting room as a warning
before turning the lights on again.
